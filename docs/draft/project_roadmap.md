# Enterprise AI Development Request

## Project Overview

I'm developing Enterprise AI, a platform that enables users to create autonomous AI teams with specialized roles (e.g., Developer, Researcher, Analyst) that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. The system is based on a multi-agent architecture with dynamic role assignment, tool authorization, and team coordination capabilities.

## Architecture Context

Enterprise AI follows a modular architecture with these key components:

- Core infrastructure (config, logging, exceptions, schemas)
- Tool framework with specialized tools for different domains
- Agent system with dynamic role creation
- Team coordination for inter-agent communication
- Workflow orchestration for complex task management
- Secure execution environments for code and commands

## Current Progress

[REPLACE WITH YOUR CURRENT PROGRESS]
Example:

- Completed the core configuration system with support for loading settings from TOML files
- Implemented the logging infrastructure with rotating file handlers
- Created the basic exception hierarchy for consistent error handling
- Defined the foundational schema classes for messages and tool calls
- Started implementing the base tool framework but having issues with the execution flow

## Development Focus

[REPLACE WITH YOUR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT FOCUS]
Example:

- Component: tool/base.py and tool/tool_collection.py
- Phase: Phase 2 (Tool Foundation)
- Expected Functionality: Implement the base tool classes and tool collection system that will allow agents to discover and execute tools with appropriate permissions

Hello, hope you're well,
I need your help in thoroughly analyzing and resolving issues in my Python project. I will provide the full source code of the project, including the Makefile. The project has multiple .py files, and I need a systematic approach to correct the errors and improve the codebase.
Expectations:

1. Analysis: Carefully analyze the code structure, dependencies, and logic in the entire project.
1. Error Identification: Identify issues like type incompatibilities, syntax errors, or logical bugs.
1. Proposed Fixes:
   - For each file containing errors, either:
     - Rewrite the entire function where the error occurs with a corrected implementation, OR
     - Rewrite the entire class in which the error is located with a corrected version.
   - If necessary, make suggestions for structural or architectural improvements for the overall project.
1. Methodology:
   - Your corrections should ensure compliance with best practices, type hints, and the use of consistent coding standards.
   - Highlight your reasoning for each change or improvement.
     Key Details:

- The errors detected so far include type incompatibility issues with mypy, among others, but I want you to analyze comprehensively and not limit yourself to these errors.
- You can also recommend improvements in the Makefile for better task automation or efficiency.
  Your insights and corrections will help improve the quality of the project. Please take a deep and methodical approach to provide the most accurate and optimal solutions.

Hello,

I am working on a project called **Enterprise AI**, designed to create a platform of multi-role AI agents. My project is partially based on an open-source project, which serves as a reference, but my implementation differs in features and architecture. I will provide you with:

1. The current code of my project, where I left off.
1. The source code of the open-source project I used as a foundation.

### Objectives and Expectations:

1. **Thorough Analysis**: Compare my project with the open-source project to identify similarities and differences. Analyze the structure, architecture, and functionalities of my current project.
1. **Development Contributions**: Continue the development of my project, respecting its architecture and specifications, while leveraging relevant concepts from the open-source project without blindly copying it.
   - For files or classes that need modification or addition, propose a clear refactor or new implementation.
   - Use a methodical approach, justifying every design or code change made.
1. **Strict Type Declaration Compliance**: Ensure that all type declarations in the code are respected and properly utilized. Implement type annotations consistently and accurately in all rewritten or newly written code.
1. **Professional Standards**: Approach the development task with the highest level of professionalism, adhering to coding best practices, clean and modular code, and robust error handling. Document each change clearly with well-structured comments and provide explanations for your decisions.
1. **Scope Compliance**: Do not simply copy the code from the open-source project. Instead, adapt its concepts intelligently to align with my project's requirements.

### Methodology Instructions:

- Progressively continue development based on the files or modules I will provide.
- Prioritize precision, professionalism, and strict adherence to my project's unique architecture and requirements.

### Project Context:

Enterprise AI is a platform for collaborative AI agents with:

- **Agent Hierarchy** for team structuring.
- **Role-Based Specialization** to assign agents to specific domains of expertise.
- **Workflow Orchestration** to manage complex processes.
- **Multi-Tool Integration** to provide agents with tools based on their roles.

I will provide files progressively. Please approach this rigorously, respecting type declarations and delivering professional, high-quality work.
